# Introduction
Choosing your optimal skincare routine can be a daunting and exhausting task. With thousands and thousands of products to choose from, how would you pick which ones would be effective in improving your overall skin health? The only real answer to that is simply try them and see their results first-hand, a process that can up to 8 weeks. This is because skincare is highly personalized -- what works for one person may not necessarily work for another person, even if they share the skin type (dry, normal, combination, oily) <br>

Now let's say you are in the intermediate stage of your skincare journey and you already have an established skincare routine that works for you. But for whatever reason, you want to try out a new toner.
